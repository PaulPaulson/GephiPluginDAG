OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category: Layout
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: Simple Layout for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The nodes are arranged in discrete layers so that the edges will always point downwards (if no loop exists). The nodes are arranged as far to the top as possible. The horizontal layout is done by assigning the nodes to discrete slots in each layer. While running, slots are chosen randomly and swapped if this would make the edges shorter.
