OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Simple Layout for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). \
    The nodes are arranged in discrete layers so that the edges will always point downwards (if no loop exists). \
    The nodes are arranged as far to the top as possible. \
    The horizontal layout is done by assigning the nodes to discrete slots in each layer. \
    While running, slots are chosen randomly and swapped if this would make the edges shorter.
